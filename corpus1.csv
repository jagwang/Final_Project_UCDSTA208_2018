Namely, the various ways in which hardcore gameplay characterized in part by regular playing sessions of more than 2 hours, several times a week, since before the third grade  seem to transform the nighttime imaginings of study participants who fit that profile.

"The distinction between leisure and unavoidable activities is not a rigidly defined one, e.g. people sometimes do work-oriented tasks for pleasure as well as for long-term utility.[5] A distinction may also be drawn between free time and leisure. For example, Situationist International maintains that free time is illusory and rarely fully ""free""; economic and social forces appropriate free time from the individual and sell it back to them as the commodity known as ""leisure"".[6] Certainly most people's leisure activities are not a completely free choice and may be constrained by social pressures, e.g. people may be coerced into spending time gardening by the need to keep up with the standard of neighbouring gardens or go to a party because of social pressures."

We have played monopoly in video game form, too and that was much more fun, more organization (I hate the board game monopoly. its so long and it brings out the worst in people. but online it was not like that for some reason). I think the computer just makes it more fun and modern which seems to impress the kids more. They are more interested if technology is involved."
"It's a fun common activity that we can enjoy when the weather isn't great, or it's after dark but before bed time. They love trying to beat me (maaaybe sometimes I let them hehe)."

"I am no professional but I am pretty certain that my 14 year old son has a definite video game addiction. And it is to only one game, Call of duty. He was introduced to this by my ex a few years ago. Started off ok, but then his grades dropped to the point that he is barely passing, little to no social interaction unless it was online. He can go days upon days without showering, barely eating, or even seeing daylight and will play from the time he wakes up until early morning hours until he falls asleep. Then the day starts over. He will pass on going places and if I make him go, he is miserable the whole time and I wished that I had just left him at home. The few times that he had a sleepover with a friend or his cousins, he would forget that they are there because he is so wrapped up in the game. Also, he can be playing online, have the computer on, and watch youtube videos on his phone of OTHER people playing call of duty all at the same time. I have the hardest time trying to get him to do chores or anything that does not have call of duty attached to it. I have taken the game away several times only to end up giving it back only for him to start the cycle all over again. I am at my wits end and want to seek professional help. It literally seems that this video game is his life."
I don't see any changes at all since playing the games. I try to limit the exposure to the video games.

"Video games generally bring isolation and segregation. The children will disappear for hours, and days at a time to play games online with their friends. This leads to introverted and anti-social behaviour and causes them to stay up too late at night which adversely affects their performance in school. "
"im not sure, its sometimes fun but it doesnt really change anything"
It brings on friendly competition and a bonding experience since I played games as a child.
"It gets us closer. We do play board games, but sometimes we enjoy video games more, esp if it's a harder game and we need to work together as a team."
It's a way to have competition. I enjoy hearing them laugh when they play but it also can lead to arguments with our youngest (5) who thinks she can play with her older brothers.  We are very competitive so it can get heated at times.
It keeps us all interested and teaches us how to be good sports

"It brings us closer together.  I prefer when my step son plays games with us instead of alone in his room, because it's great to spend time altogether.  We get to chat while we play and it's a great way to spend an evening. "
"We can have fun together without leaving our home,"
"It makes us much closer, helps us bond, and helps us communicate. "
"he vast majority of video games are now designed with cooperative play options. Whether it’s fighting off alien invaders, solving puzzles, or being on the same bobsleigh team, video games offer kids a wealth of opportunities to constructively work together."
we enjoy spending time together in a different way. 

It makes us all happy and enjoy our time together.
"its bring back our fun, stress less life after a long time.  "

It brings a time where we can talk about anything.
"Maybe you're meandering, alone and lost, through an abandoned castle surrounded by a crocodile-filled moat. Suddenly, a flame-breathing dragon hurls towards you, snarling and gnashing its teeth, coming in for the kill. Do you wake up from this bizarro nightmare, covered in sweat and close to tears? Or do you stay in the dream, grab your imaginary sword, and walk boldly into battle? /  / If your answer is the latter, then Jayne Gackenbach would suspect you're also a hardcore gamer. /  / Gackenbach is a psychologist at Canada's Grant MacEwan University and arguably the world's preeminent expert on how video games can impact dreaming. In the early 1990's, her son Teace (with whom Gackenback later co-authored a book on gaming) started playing Nintendo, and Gackenbach found herself fascinated with the potential impacts of her son's new hobby. Namely, the various ways in which hardcore gameplay — characterized in part by regular playing sessions of more than 2 hours, several times a week, since before the third grade — seem to transform the nighttime imaginings of study participants who fit that profile. Those transformations, Gackenbach says, also offer insights into how video gaming might shape an individual's experiences in the waking world."
"It adds some fun to the evenings.  We try not to let the kids play individually too much so that they don't ""tunnel""."
I don't believe playing video games brings any changes to my family.
I think it really brings the family a bit closer.  Me and my son enjoy doing this sometimes and it really helps us bond and talk about stuff that we normally would not talk about.
It gives us something fun to do and brings us closer.

It makes the kids include me in their life where otherwise I would not fit in. 
It helps us to interact with each other and have fun together. We can have something in common to share.

It brings us close together and gives us something to do with one another.
They bring a sense of adventure and excitement to sometimes dull days.
It gives us something to relate too. Gets us to spend time and socialize together.

It gives us a new way to interact with each other. A competitive way. My sons an athlete and he loves sports but aside from spectating we really can't engage in that with him. Video games is a way that we now can.
We have something to connect us that we both enjoy doing.






None because I do not play them with them. We do other things 


It lets us play together even with them being so far away.

"Gives us one more thing to do together, it is a good activity for winding down after long days. "

"MOSTLY GAMES ARE KIDS ALSO ADDICT THAT GAME. SO MIND GAMES, AND MEMORY GAMES ARE I LIKE IT. SO IMPROVE THE MORE MEMORY GAMES ARE LAUNCHED."

Helps give us inside jokes and sayings we pick up from games. Keeps us connected on the same interests.


It makes the family closer. Everyone is giving time for each other.
"It allows grown children to still be present in family activities, even from another location. It gives us something in common to discuss that is not dependent on age, or generation, or viewpoint. The racing and party games are always a good laugh. I think that games bring generations very different in mindset together."

It's an activity that we can do together. Video games have brought us closer together. 

We all will be refreshed and more interractive in those time

We all learn to share with each other and wait for our turn.

Togetherness and time to talk about things and to have fun and forget problems

"As for the actual benefits that come from playing video games, Isabela Granic and her co-authors provide a comprehensive review of the research literature showing that video games can develop skills in the following areas:"
"The most recent issue of the American Journal of Play (Fall, 2014) includes an article by researchers Adam Eichenbaum, Daphne Bavelier, and C. Shawn Green summarizing recent research demonstrating long-lasting positive effects of video games on basic mental processes--such as perception, attention, memory, and decision-making.  Most of the research involves effects of action video games—that is, games that require players to move rapidly, keep track of many items at once, hold a good deal of information in their mind at once, and make split-second decisions.  Many of the abilities tapped by such games are precisely those that psychologists consider to be the basic building blocks of intelligence."

Happiness and good understanding well each other. 
"2This Thesis is brought to you for free and open access by the Graduate ... between participants and their family members. ... time an individual spent playing video games and the amount of parent ...

Just building that relationship of working together.  It shows my daughter that we are always here to help.
Allows kids to do something they enjoy and that I can join them in doing.
"Not a whole lot, it brings a difference of entertainment for that moment."

They show the competitive side of each family member and in some cases we work together in a game.  A lot depends on what game it is.
It gives us time to laugh and have fun together. Bonding.























"I'm not sure there is any change. We don't play a great deal and my son is able to stop/turn the game off when asked. I think it has helped him to develop some comfort using technology---a tablet, a mouse/computer---and that helps his hand eye coordination. / I also enjoy the games where the choices we make for our characters affects what happens next. Those are fun for story telling and such.  All in all, these games can be a nice way to unwind."
It makes our time to go fastly and it makes us to laugh.
I think my family like my children aidict the video game


Everyone is laughing and getting along even in the middle of competition.

Adds a commonality to talk about and get conversations started. Increases teamwork.
"I'd like to think it brings us closer together, but if it weren't video games I'm sure we'd be filling the time with something else. I'm really glad it's video games though, because I don't imagine anything else bringing us as much enjoyment and laughter"
"To keep together, enjoying the fun, supporting during failures, and teaching the techniques to kids."

It allows me to find  common ground with my kids so that we cant alway have something to talk about.

"it helps us spend time together, the competition is fun also"

It makes an activity that would normally be done alone a family affair 
It fills the time with something fun to do that they don't often have time for.
When we all play together it is fun but we all have our own sets of friends even in the gaming world.  We can be safe in our home in different rooms but still feel very close







It doesn't really change the family dynamics. I play because my kids enjoy it and I wan to see what interests them.




















"Our team already includes interns and volunteers that have faced struggles in their life: wheelchair users, deaf and hard of hearing, chemo survivors, members of the LGBT community. We channel our experiences into a piece of meaningful work. There’s a reason for all we do. As we work together, we learn about each other’s perspectives. This is what change means to us: it always starts with passion.  As our project grows, we also begin to need resources to get to the next  stage. A few dollars can make all the difference."




It makes our family closer because a lot of the time we talk about other things going on in our life while we're playing games. I have learned a lot about my kids while playing games with them.
It brings us closer and we talk and laugh. It's a great time to catch up on things

I THINK IT BRINGS US CLOSER AND GIVES US TIME TO TALK ABOUT OTHER STUFF WHILE WE ARE PLAYING
